- 👋 Hi, I’m @datumarina
- 👀 I’m making a career switch from marketing to data science, and feel very energized and curious (and a bit scared!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science at BrainStation
- 💞️ My capstone project will be on Olist e-commerce data where I will attempt to answer business questions I had asked myself many times in my previous jobs
- 📫 How to reach me marina.mnoyan@gmail.com
